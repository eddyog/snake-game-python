# snake-game-python

The player controls a long, thin creature,
resembling a snake, which roams around on
a bordered plane, picking up food (or some
other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail
or the edges of the playing area. Each time
the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows
longer, making the game increasingly
difficult. The user controls the direction of
the snake's head (up, down, left, or right),
and the snake's body follows.
